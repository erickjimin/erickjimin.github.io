# Finding SQL Injection Point

Today’s topic focuses on identifying where SQL Injection can occur.

As mentioned in other posts, SQL Injection (SQLi) can be divided into three main types:
- Union-based SQL Injection
- Error-based SQL Injection
- Blind SQL Injection

The ultimate goal of all three is to retrieve data from the server's database by executing SQL SELECT statements.
Among these, Blind SQL Injection can be used in almost any situation where SQLi is possible. However, it's relatively slow and cumbersome, so it's important to choose the most efficient method for the situation.

### How to find Injection Points

To locate SQL Injection points, you need to find where there’s interaction between user input and the database. Web pages often include static data—like the site title, which is hardcoded in HTML—or dynamic data fetched from the database.

Common dynamic interaction points include:
- Bulletin boards (forums)
- Login pages
- Sign-up pages

SQL queries like INSERT, SELECT, and more will be used in such places.
Rather than blindly injecting ' OR '1'='1, it's critical to first analyze the SQL query that might be executed and then inject

When crafting SQLi payloads:
```
Always have a reason for injecting specific values.
Avoid using SQL comments (--, #) in complex targets.
These may prevent the query from executing correctly if the system handles queries differently.
```

Let’s look at a few case studies.


## 1. Cookie-Based SQL Injection

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aadb8b00-e263-4808-bc51-01ffe6129bf5)
My Page view when cookie = jimin 

In this case, we try manipulating the user cookie value to determine if it can influence the SQL query.

We hypothesize the server-side query looks like:
```
$username = $_COOKIE['user'];
$result = mysqli_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id = '$username'");
When the cookie is jimin, the query becomes:
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id = 'jimin';
```
We assume that the page's output depends on whether result contains a row (i.e., num_rows > 0).
Now, We can try injecting:
- 'jimin' and '1'='1 → should return the same result as 'jimin'
- 'jimin' and '1'='2 → should return nothing if it's evaluated as false

Injection with '1'='1 returns normal page

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0336d114-4a9c-4cb0-b030-61853b197600)
Injection with '1'='2 removes the “Nothing Here...” message

From this, we confirm that different responses occur depending on true/false conditions in the SQL query. Hence, there is an SQL Injection vulnerability.



## 2. Column Name-Based SQL Injection

There is a feature in the forum that lets users search or sort based on specific columns.
At this point, the value included in the URL or POST parameter is used in place of a column name in the SQL query.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/766b3eb2-6d26-4f6f-8b16-bbff9523d951)

Now, let’s once again try to predict the SQL query just like we did in section 1.
Since this is a forum, it will likely use a SELECT statement to show posts to users.
Let’s imagine how the parameter board_result=test will be incorporated into the query.
Usually, the query applies a LIKE clause to the input to display only posts that contain the entered keyword.
In other words, we can assume a structure like:
```
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE [option_val] LIKE '%[board_result]%';
```

Now that we’ve identified a suspicious input point, let’s try inserting different values to determine whether SQL Injection is truly possible.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/274a1ca4-864c-4068-82d3-0da58cec341b)
We inserted ('1'='1') and test into option_val.
The expected SQL query would look like:
```
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE ('1'='1') and test LIKE '%[board_result]%';
```
Since the forum displays results normally,
we can assume the value we inserted is being used in the query.
Now let’s try a false case to differentiate between true and false.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/022f7182-861d-4eee-8400-67b6e2885893)
As expected, after inserting ('1'='2') and test into option_val, it evaluates as false and no posts are displayed.


## 3. ORDER BY SQL Injection

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c41eb75b-6bbc-4e6e-831c-fa778ad024ce)
Just like the previous two methods, let’s first try to infer the SQL query structure inside the server using Burp Suite.

```
option_val=title&board_result=oliver&board_search=%F0%9F%94%8D&date_from=&date_to=&sort=title
```
In this URL, the parameters we should focus on are option_val, board_result, and finally sort.
We already inferred that option_val is used as a column name, and board_result goes into the LIKE clause.
Now, let’s try to guess how sort is being used.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c748727f-2ab8-44fa-8664-dfdf320377e2)
When we send sort=10, the forum displays properly.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bcab527-4c26-464f-a88e-a02c19e5d004)
When we send sort=11, the forum does not display any results

From this, we can predict that the value of sort is being used in the ORDER BY [ ] clause.
This is because ORDER BY causes an error when its index exceeds the number of columns, and the behavior we see is consistent with that logic.



So, the SQL query can be expected to look like this
```
SELECT * FROM table_name  
WHERE [option_val]
LIKE '%[board_result]%'  
ORDER BY [sort];
```
Now that we’ve determined sort is used in the ORDER BY clause, the next step is figuring out how to use it to distinguish between true and false.


### case when
```
format: case when (condition) then (value_if_true else) (value_if_false) end  
ex: case when (1=1) then 1 else 2 end → 1  
    case when (1=2) then 1 else 2 end → 2
```
Using this CASE WHEN syntax, we can manipulate the sort value to differentiate between true and false.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27270259-3f34-4e22-bb38-047d74feb559)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3995c268-6a7b-49ea-92c0-b44028539c50)
```
&sort=case when (1=1) then username else title end 

-> if the value is true = username 

&sort=case when (1=2) then username else title end 

-> if the value is false = title
```

However, since we can’t be sure whether username and title are valid column names, we can use the following method which intentionally triggers an error.
```
sort=case when (1=1) then 1  > If true, the query sorts by the first column 
else (select 1 union select 2) end  > If false, it tries to sort by two values (1 and 2), causing an error
```


If (1=1) is true, sort becomes 1, so the server executes ORDER BY 1 and sorts using the first column.
If (1=2) is false, then sort becomes something like (SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2), which tries to sort by two values and causes a SQL error.

The reason for causing an error is because we don’t know the number or names of columns in the server’s DB, so we cause an error to distinguish between true and false conditions.



## 4. DB Error

When testing for injection points, if inserting true/false conditions does not cause any visible change, you may need to deliberately trigger a syntax error (e.g., unmatched single quotes) to force the database to return an error.

```
user=jimin' and (select 1 union select 2 where (1=2)) and '1'='1;
```

Let’s try inserting the above value into the user parameter.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52893605-d928-4d56-92d0-57c1b5f22718)
The page loads without any problem.

Now, let’s change where (1=2) to where (1=1).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ed4fb6a-8c06-490f-b3b8-5907691e78fd)
A database error occurs.

In other words, when 1=1, the query SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 returns two rows, but the SQL statement is expecting only a single value, so it results in a syntax error
This kind of SQL error can help us distinguish between true and false conditions in Blind SQL Injection.


## 5. SQL Injection Defense Methods

### 5.1 Prepared Statement 
Prepared Statements are queries that are precompiled and only filled with user input later.
Because the query structure and the input are completely separated, the input cannot affect the structure of the query.

```
01001001001_________01101010
→ A fixed structure where only values are filled in.
```

Advantages
- Can fundamentally block SQL Injection
- Query structure stays unchanged, no matter the input

 Why we still learn SQL Injection despite having Prepared Statements
- When Prepared Statements are used incorrectly
Example: Concatenating strings to build queries
```
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " . $_GET['id']);
-> $_GET['id] is directly included in the query.
```

- Cases where Prepared Statements cannot be used at all
**ORDER BY, table names, and column names** cannot be passed as parameters, so Prepared Statements don’t apply.


 ### 5.2 Whitelist-Based Filtering

- Whitelist Filtering
    : Only allow specific safe words to be used.

```
Example
$sort = $_GET['sort'];

if ($sort == 'title' || $sort == 'username') {
    $query = "SELECT * FROM board ORDER BY $sort";
} else {
    echo "Sorting method not allowed.";
    exit;
}
➡ Only title and username are allowed. All other inputs are blocked.
```
- Blacklist Filtering
Blocks only forbidden words (e.g., ' or 1=1, --, etc.)
