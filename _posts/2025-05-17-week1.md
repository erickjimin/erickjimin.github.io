## 1. Preparing the Lab Environment

Before starting the course, I set up the practical lab environment by completing the following:

- Installing a virtual machine platform  
- Downloading the VM image (OVA file)  
- Setting up Termius and Visual Studio Code  

### 1.1 Installing VMware Workstation 17

I downloaded and installed VMware Workstation 17 from the official site:  
**VMware Workstation Download**

### 1.2 Downloading the Web Development Practice OVA File

I downloaded the provided OVA file from the course website.

### 1.3 Importing the OVA File into Workstation

Inside VMware Workstation:

1. Clicked “Open a Virtual Machine”  
2. Selected the downloaded OVA file  
3. Set a VM name and imported it  

✅ The virtual machine was successfully created.

### 1.4 Installing Termius and Connecting to the Web Server

I installed Termius, a modern SSH client:  
**Termius Download**

Termius allows remote management of servers via SSH.

After installation:

- Clicked “New Host”  
- Found the web server’s IP address within the VM  
- Entered the IP address, username, and password into Termius  
- ✅ Successfully connected to the remote web server

### 1.5 Installing Visual Studio Code

I installed Visual Studio Code for code editing and server management:  
**Visual Studio Code Download**

## 2. Understanding the Basics of a Web Server

### 2.1 What Is a Web Server?

A web server is like a “friend” that sends files upon request.  
However, to request files, the server must be running first.

Initially, the virtual machine we created is simply a Linux-based computer.  
To function as a web server, we need to start the web server software manually.

### 2.2 Running a Web Server

Inside the VM, I executed the following command: sudo python3 -m http.server 80

### 2.3 URL Structure

Once the web server was running, I accessed it through a browser.

**URL Structure:**
[Protocol Name]://[Domain or IP Address]:[Port]/[File Path]



**Example:**
http://192.168.111.132:80/test.txt

**Key Components:**

- **Protocol Name**: Determines the communication method (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS)  
- **Domain or IP Address**: Specifies the server’s location  
- **Port**: Identifies the specific service (HTTP commonly uses port 80)  
- **File Path**: Points to the file on the server

### 2.4 Web Root Directory Concept

The web root is the highest directory accessible by the web server.  
Only files under this root directory can be requested.

**Example:**

If the server is started inside the `webBasic` folder,  
→ Only files under `webBasic` can be accessed.  
Files outside this root (like from `webDev`) cannot be retrieved directly.

This restriction protects the server from unauthorized file access.

---

### 2.5 Why Website URLs Look Different

- **Omitted Port Numbers**:  
  Browsers automatically assume port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS, so it’s often not displayed.

- **No File Paths Shown**:  
  If no file is specified, the server automatically serves `index.html` by convention.

## 3. Introduction to Dynamic Web Pages and WAS (Web Application Server)

### 3.1 Why We Need Dynamic Pages

Imagine three users (A, B, and C) logging into a website.  
If we created a static HTML page for each user individually, it would be inefficient and unmanageable.

Instead, WAS (Web Application Server) dynamically generates personalized pages based on user input and a common template.

This method allows one server to serve customized pages to thousands of users efficiently.

---

### 3.2 How the Server Receives User Data

- The user sends a request (like login info) through the browser.  
- The server passes the request to the WAS.  
- The WAS dynamically generates and returns a web page based on the input data.  

Data is sent to the server via **GET** or **POST** methods.

---

### 3.3 Using PHP for Dynamic Content

I created a simple PHP file:

```php
<?php
    echo $_GET['id'];
    echo $_GET['pass'];
?>
This PHP script displays the user’s input received via the URL.
```

### 3.4 Understanding GET vs POST Methods
Method	Characteristics
GET	Sends data in the URL. Visible. Used for simple queries.
POST	Sends data in the HTTP body. Hidden. Used for secure data like login forms.

Example:

GET:
http://192.168.111.132:1018/login.php?id=jimin

POST:
http://192.168.111.132:1018/login.php (Data hidden)
