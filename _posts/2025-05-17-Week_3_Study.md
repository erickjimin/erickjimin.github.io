## 1. What Is Login?

A **login process** verifies that a person is who they say they are. It involves two distinct concepts:

### 🔹 Identification  
Pinpoints who the user is (e.g., with an ID)

- Example: Your username or student number  
- Even if exposed, IDs are not dangerous by themselves  

### 🔹 Authentication  
Verifies whether the identified person is really that person

- Example: Password, fingerprint, 2FA  
- If authentication info is leaked, it’s a serious issue

## 2. Login Logic: Different Implementation Approaches

I learned and implemented four types of login logic based on how **identification** and **authentication** are handled.

### (1) Identification + Authentication in a Single Query

```php
$sql = "SELECT * FROM member WHERE id = '$user' AND pass = '$user_pass'";
```
One query handles both steps at once

Simple and direct

❗ Vulnerable to SQL injection if not handled safely

(2) Identification and Authentication Separately
```
$sql = "SELECT * FROM member WHERE id = '$user'";
$db_pass = $row['pass'];

if ($db_pass == $user_pass) {
  // login success
}
```
First, the user is identified

Then, authentication is performed using stored data

Slightly more flexible (e.g., logging login attempts, custom logic)

3. Why Use Hashing?
A hash is a one-way mathematical function that turns any input (like a password) into a fixed-length, seemingly random string.

Even a tiny change in the input creates a completely different output

✅ You can never go backward (irreversible)

🔐 Example
Input: password123
→ SHA256: ef92b778bafe771e89245b89ecbc08a44a4e166c06659911881f383d4473e94f

Input: password124
→ SHA256: 4bc1ef8ad3fc3e86f43aef63f1e97a3489a50bc7cf84581216a5b9de4b37fd78

The password for the user ‘Lisa’ has been securely hashed.

🔍 Hash vs Encryption vs Encoding
Concept	Explanation
Hashing	One-way. You can’t reverse it. Used to verify data.
Encryption	Two-way. Can be decrypted with a key. Confidential.
Encoding	Not secure. Just for formatting (e.g., Base64).

4. Maintaining Login State: Cookie vs Session
🍪 Cookie
Stored on the client-side

Can be modified by the user, which is a security risk

🔐 Session
Stored server-side

Client holds only a session ID (random string)

✅ Much safer than cookies
