# 1. What is Union SQL Injection

In SQL Injection, an attacker try attempts to bypass login authentication in order to extract datta from the database. Typically, to test whether a website is vulnerable to SQL Injection, we target pages that interact with a database. 
If the webpage is static such as one that simply just show the image, we cannot get any useful data. Normally, there are two cases.  

(1) Pages where data from the database is displayed on the webpage, such as forums or message boards  
(2) Pages where data is not displayed, like login forms or ID duplication checks

In this post, we'll focus on the first case—how to extract data when it is visibly rendered on the web page.

This webpage get the password from the user. In this case, I will attempt to take all of users data from database. For getting all of data in database we need to 만족시켜야한다 these two 조건문을 first is id = ' ' and second is ' ' . Now, the id data is static as 'normaltic', so we 조건을 항상 true로 만들기위헤서 pass = ' '에 들어가는 입력값을 고민해보야한다.

['or '1'=1']을 sql 쿼리에 넣으면 pass의 값이 올바르지않아 id에 and 연산자를포함한 계산이 false가 되더라도 sql 쿼리의 연산 우선순위는 and 다음 or 이기때문에 1=1이 무조건 참이므로 앞의 and 연산의 결과에 상관없이 sql 전체 쿼리는 무조건 참이 된다.
