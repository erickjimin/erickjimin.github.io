# 1. What is Union SQL Injection

In SQL Injection, an attacker try attempts to bypass login authentication in order to extract datta from the database. Typically, to test whether a website is vulnerable to SQL Injection, we target pages that interact with a database. 
If the webpage is static such as one that simply just show the image, we cannot get any useful data. Normally, there are two cases.  

(1) Pages where data from the database is displayed on the webpage, such as forums or message boards  
(2) Pages where data is not displayed, like login forms or ID duplication checks

In this post, we'll focus on the first caseâ€”how to extract data when it is visibly rendered on the web page.

This webpage retrieves the password from the user. In this case, I will attempt to extract all user data from the database.
To achieve this, we need to satisfy two conditions in the SQL query:

First: id = '...'

Second: pass = '...'

In this scenario, the id is statically set to 'normaltic', so our focus is on crafting an input for the pass field that will make the entire condition always evaluate to true.

Even though the condition id = 'normaltic' AND pass = '' might be false,
the OR '1'='1' part will always be true.
Because of SQL's operator precedence (AND is evaluated before OR), the overall query still returns true.
As a result, the query will return all records from the table, regardless of the id and pass values.

# 2. Union SQL Injection
## 2.1 What is Union 
The UNION operator combines the results of two SELECT statements into a single result set.
Each SELECT must return the same number of columns with compatible data types.

Basic Syntax
```
(SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1) UNION (SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2);
```

Example 
Input [1234' union select * from member where id = 'fake]

SQL qurey 
```
select * from member where id = 'normaltic' and pass = '1234'
union
select * from member where id = 'fake'
```


Input [' or '1'='1' union select 'jimin', '5678', 'jimin@test.com', 'user]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/412a4683-5a04-4f67-ac29-f19e71a263af)

SQL qurey 
```
select * from member where id = 'normaltic' and pass = '' or '1'='1'
union
select 'jimin', '5678', 'jimin@test.com', 'user'
```

When using UNION, the number of columns in the SELECT statements before and after must match exactly.
Even if you use a query like SELECT 'jimin', '5678', 'jimin@test.com', 'user' with data that doesn't exist in the database, it will still be displayed in the result.
However, this does not mean the data is actually inserted into the database.
