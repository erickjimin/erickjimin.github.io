# 1. What is Union SQL Injection

In SQL Injection, an attacker try attempts to bypass login authentication in order to extract datta from the database. Typically, to test whether a website is vulnerable to SQL Injection, we target pages that interact with a database. 
If the webpage is static such as one that simply just show the image, we cannot get any useful data. Normally, there are two cases.  

(1) Pages where data from the database is displayed on the webpage, such as forums or message boards  
(2) Pages where data is not displayed, like login forms or ID duplication checks

In this post, we'll focus on the first caseâ€”how to extract data when it is visibly rendered on the web page.
