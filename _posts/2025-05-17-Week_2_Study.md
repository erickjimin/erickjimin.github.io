## ðŸ”¹ What Is a Database?

A database (DB) is used to store data, much like an Excel file.

| Concept  | Analogy          |
|----------|------------------|
| Database | An Excel file    |
| Table    | A sheet in Excel |
| Column   | A column         |
| Row      | A single entry   |

To interact with the database, I used **SQL (Structured Query Language)** â€” a language used to communicate with databases.

## ðŸ”¹ Basic SQL Commands

Here are some core SQL statements I practiced:

### `SELECT`  
Used to retrieve data:
```sql
SELECT name FROM test_table;
INSERT
```
Used to add data:

INSERT INTO test_table (name, score) VALUES ('Jimin Han', 95);
WHERE

Used to filter results:

```
SELECT * FROM test_table WHERE name = 'Jimin Han';
SELECT * FROM test_table WHERE name = 'Jimin Han' AND password = '1234';
SELECT * FROM test_table WHERE name = 'Jimin Han' OR password = '1234';
```

ðŸ”¹ Connecting PHP to MySQL
To make the PHP web server talk to the database, I used the mysqli_connect() function like this:


```
<?php
$db_conn = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'admin', 'student1234', 'test');
?>
```

ðŸ’¡ In many real-world cases, the Web Server, WAS (Web Application Server), and DB exist on separate machines.
Thatâ€™s why 'localhost' here refers to the DB server IP (when theyâ€™re running on the same machine).

ðŸ”¹ Checking the Database Connection
I wrote a PHP script to test the connection:

```
<?php
$db_conn = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'admin', 'student1234', 'test');

if ($db_conn) {
    echo "DB connect OK";
} else {
    echo "DB connect fail";
}

$sql = "SELECT * FROM test_table";
$result = mysqli_query($db_conn, $sql);

var_dump($result);
?>
```

When I ran this, the output was a PHP object representing the result of the SQL query.
It showed me that the connection was successful and that the data retrieval worked correctly.
